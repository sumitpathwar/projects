Student Management System (C++) – Project Overview for Resume
Project Scope:
Developed a comprehensive Student Management System in C++ supporting academic administration for a university. The system allows secure logins for faculty and students and manages core academic operations, including student records, grades, fees, attendance, and timetabling.

Key Features & Modules:

Login System: Secure authentication for faculty and students with limited login attempts.

Student Information: Add, view, and delete student profiles including personal, academic, and demographic details. Built with error checking for data integrity (e.g., date and contact validation).

Marksheet Module: Enter and display marks for core subjects, compute total, percentage, assign grade and pass/fail status; supports result visualization in tabular format.

Attendance Tracker: Record daily attendance per period, calculate attendance percentage, and guide students to improve attendance if at risk.

Exam Scheduling: Faculty can set and display exam dates for all subjects.

Fee Accounts & EMI: Fee calculation (with support for EMI schemes) and fines for late or damaged property; automated receipting.

Time Table & Calendar: View class schedules and an auto-generated full-year academic calendar.

Courses Offered: Display details and eligibility of all degree programs available.

Technologies Used:

C++ (OOP Principles) – Classes for modularity (inheritance, encapsulation).

Standard Library: <iostream>, <fstream>, <string>, <iomanip>, <cstdlib>, plus OS-specific <windows.h>.

File I/O: Persistent storage of student records and attendance using text files (fstream).

Error Handling: Try-catch blocks for input validation.

System Commands: UI cleanup (system("CLS")), color changes, and simple animations.

Sample Entry 1
Student Management System – C++

Developed a full-featured Student Management System in C++, integrating modules for student record management, marksheet generation, exam scheduling, fee accounting (including EMI), attendance tracking, and university calendar.

Implemented secure multi-login functionality for students and faculty, ensuring role-appropriate access and protection against brute-force attacks.

Designed robust input validation and exception-handling to maintain data integrity across modules, including personal data, academic results, and fee payments.

Utilized file operations to ensure persistent storage, supporting record addition, search, update, and deletion.

Automated grade calculation, result display, and attendance monitoring, including real-time feedback for students at risk of low attendance.

Designed readable text-based menus and interactive reports with formatted outputs, enhancing user interaction.

Sample Entry 2
C++ Student Management System

Built an object-oriented, menu-driven software solution for university academic operations, featuring modules for grade management, attendance tracking, exam scheduling, and fee accounting.

Implemented error-checking routines for reliable data entry, and efficient file I/O for durable record management.

Led design of the user authentication system, ensuring secure login for multiple roles (student/faculty) with locked account after repeated failed attempts.

Developed intuitive navigation and reporting features, including printable cards for attendance, results, and fee receipts.

Thoroughly tested modules, proactively handling edge cases in dates, scores, and fee calculations to ensure robustness.
